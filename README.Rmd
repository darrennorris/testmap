The goal of testmap is to map future population changes of 
the Yellow-spotted river turtle (*Podocnemis unifilis*).

## Objectives
These maps are being used to

 - Provide an updated assesment of how threatened the species is.

 - Inform development of and implement improvements to the modelling process.

 
## Results
Summaries of the results including maps of the projected future changes 
can be found online.

 - 3 generation.    
 Predicted changes after 42 years: https://darrennorris.github.io/testmap/articles/Interactive-map.html

## Installation

You can download the data to check and visualise using R.
testmap cannot be submitted to CRAN as the data files are large and the package 
does not therefore pass "cran" checks.

So you need to install testmap like so:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("darrennorris/testmap")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(testmap)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
